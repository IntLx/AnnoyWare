# AnnoyWare
Non Suspectable Powerful Tool
Upon opening file it opens notepad 100 times and restarts your pc 
you can edit the settings 
#to edit number of times the notepad should open 
def run_notepad():
    for _ in range(ðŸ‘‰100ðŸ‘ˆ):ðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆ
        subprocess.Popen('notepad.exe')
        time.sleep(0.1)
to edit how fast it should open its set to 0.1 which is speed of light if you want to edit just edit 0.1 to any number 
if you set it to 2.5 every 2.5 sec it opens one notepad then theres no use of calling it annoyware

to change which app it should open  "subprocess.Popen('notepad.exe')" edit notepad.exe to something else
if program openning error copy the location of the shortcut eg i cant open chrome so i open file location and copy as path
